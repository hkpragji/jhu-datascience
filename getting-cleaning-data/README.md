# Peer-graded Assignment: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

## Johns Hopkins Coursera Data Science Specialisation: Course 3

This repository contains the required files for the Getting and Cleaning Data course project.

### Project Description

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect and clean a dataset by preparing a tidy dataset that can be used for later analysis. The data provided is a Human Activity Recognition database built from the recordings of 30 subjects performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors.

### Source data

The source data can be found on the UCI Machine Learning Repository [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/240/human+activity+recognition+using+smartphones).

### Files

-   `run_analysis.R` is an R script which retrieves and cleans the data from the source and prepares a tidy dataset by:
    -   Merging the training and test datasets to create one dataset
    -   Extracting the measurements on the mean and standard deviation
    -   Using descriptive activity names to name the activities in the dataset
    -   Appropriately labelling the dataset with descriptive variable names
    -   Creating a second, independent tidy dataset with the average of each variable for each activity and subject.
-   `tidyHARdata.txt` contains the final tidy dataset as a result of the above data cleaning and transformation.
-   `codebook.Rmd` documents the cleaning/transformation process and includes the code chunks which make up the `run_analysis.R` script.

### Execution instructions

The R script `run_analysis.R` was written as a reproducible analytical pipeline (RAP), therefore, it should be easy for collaborators to run the analysis on their machines. To reproduce the analysis, fork then clone this repository, then simply open the `run_analysis.R` file and run it. There is no need to manually download the data as the script will do it for you.
